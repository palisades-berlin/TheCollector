# Session State — THE Collector

Attribution: Implemented with Codex AI, Claude, Perplexity assistance and my fantasy.

> **Rule:** Update this file before every `git push`. It is the handoff between machines and AI tools.
> **How to resume:** `git pull` → read this file → check the Tool Router → paste the opening prompt for the right tool.

## Session State Rule

<!-- SESSION_RULE:START -->

- **At the end of every session** — before any commit/push — update `SESSION.md` in the repo root with: (1) today's date and tool used, (2) what was completed this session, (3) the exact next task, (4) any open decisions or blockers.
- `SESSION.md` is the handoff file between machines and AI tools. It must always reflect the true current state of the work.
- Keep it short. 5–10 lines under each heading is enough.

## Current sprint

**v2.0 — Design System 2.0 · Phase 0: Figma Rebuild**
Roadmap ref: `docs/thecollector-2.0-90-day-roadmap.md`
Master plan: `docs/design-overhaul-master-plan-2026-03-13.md`

---

## Last session

**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Tool:** Codex

**Key discussion:** Release execution required including the dirty-tree governance/session docs and resolving marker-contract drift before packaging/publishing.

**Done:**

- Added/accepted governance markers in release scope (`BEHAVIOURAL_RULES`, `TOOL_ROUTER`) and updated `docs/marker-sync-contract.json` required/allowed marker taxonomy.
- Synced `WORKFLOW.md` `OPENING_PROMPT` mirror with canonical `SESSION.md` block to remove marker drift.
- Bumped docs/tests-only release to `1.9.97.4` across `manifest.json`, `package.json`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`.
- Executed local release gates: `test:version-policy:local`, `test:docs-policy`, `format:session`, `format:check`, `test:unit`, and `test:integration` (all passing).
- Built local validation package `dist/the-collector-v1.9.97.4.zip` via `./scripts/package-release.sh` with guardrails passing.

## Do next

**Task:** Verify green GitHub CI + CodeQL for release `v1.9.97.4`, confirm release asset `the-collector-release-zip`, then submit ZIP to Chrome Web Store.

Where: Figma file `sECUN6qSqUygWoG7PhC548` (`THECollector - UI Kit & Screens`)
What: Phase 0 checklist in master plan §6, steps 0-A through 0-F
Gate: ALL Phase 0 Figma work must be complete and approved before any Phase 1 code begins
First step (release track): inspect the `v1.9.97.4` commit/tag checks and confirm CodeQL + CI + release-assets are green.
First step after release submission: resume Figma blocker path at 0-A-1 (dark/light surface and border token updates).

**Blocker status:** active — Figma seat/capacity blocker prevents MCP execution (`View` + tool-call limit).

---

## Open decisions / blockers

- Figma permission/capacity blocker:
  - file access must be upgraded to `Editor`
  - MCP plan/call allowance must be sufficient for style update + validation pass
- CI follow-up: if any `v1.9.97.4` release checks fail (`quality`, `codeql`, `release-assets`), fix forward and re-run before submission.
- S-07/S-08 remain code-precompleted; design work stays pending until Figma unblock is resolved.

## Tool Router

Not sure which tool to reach for? Use this table.

| Task type                                              | Tool       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Research · external docs · best-practice lookup        | Perplexity |
| Prompt engineering · drafting governance text          | Perplexity |
| Design · Figma edits · token work                      | Claude     |
| ADRs · documentation · policy decisions                | Claude     |
| Interactive decisions · open-ended Q&A                 | Claude     |
| Code changes · refactoring · new features              | Codex      |
| Tests · version bumps · pre-commit checks · git / push | Codex      |

**Pipeline:** Perplexity researches → Claude designs & documents → Codex implements & ships.

**Standing rule — all tools:** When uncertain about scope, intent, or ownership — ask. Do not anticipate, assume, or proceed speculatively.

<!-- OPENING_PROMPT:START -->

## Opening prompt (paste this to start any session)

**Perplexity:**

```
Read SESSION.md (Do next + Open decisions sections). Your role: research and prompt engineering only. Summarize findings as a concise brief for Claude or Codex to act on — do not implement anything. If the scope or intent of a task is unclear, ask before proceeding.
```

**Claude:**

```
Read CLAUDE.md and SESSION.md, then continue from the last session. Your role: design (Figma MCP), documentation, ADRs, decisions. Check the Tool Router if unsure whether a task belongs here or in Codex. If scope or intent is unclear, ask — do not anticipate.
```

**Codex:**

```
Read AGENTS.md and SESSION.md, then continue from the last session. Your role: code, tests, version bumps, git. Check the Tool Router if unsure whether a task belongs here or in Claude. Run the pre-commit checklist before any push. If scope or intent is unclear, ask — do not anticipate.
```
