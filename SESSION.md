## Current sprint

**v2.0 — Design System 2.0 · Phase 0: Figma Rebuild**
Roadmap ref: `docs/thecollector-2.0-90-day-roadmap.md`
Master plan: `docs/design-overhaul-master-plan-2026-03-13.md`

---

## Last session

**Date:** 2026-03-15
**Tool:** Codex

**Key discussion:** After pushing `1.9.96.0`, GitHub CI failed only on `format:check` due `SESSION.md`; fixed with Prettier and prepared docs-only follow-up bump.

**Done:**

- Pushed two local commits (`f3240b9`, `c76ccb3`) to `main` so remote reflects local truth.
- Verified GitHub CodeQL run passed for pushed head.
- Diagnosed CI failure root cause: `prettier --check` warning in `SESSION.md`.
- Formatted `SESSION.md`, updated release docs, and bumped to `1.9.96.1` as docs-only follow-up.

---

## Do next

**Task:** Verify green GitHub CI + CodeQL runs for `1.9.96.1`, then resume Phase 0 Figma unblock and execute `0-A-1` color style tokens.

Where: Figma file `sECUN6qSqUygWoG7PhC548` (`THECollector - UI Kit & Screens`)
What: Phase 0 checklist in master plan §6, steps 0-A through 0-F
Gate: ALL Phase 0 Figma work must be complete and approved before any Phase 1 code begins
First step (GitHub checks track): confirm `1.9.96.1` quality job is green after `SESSION.md` formatting fix.
First step after Figma unblock: 0-A-1 — update colour styles (dark mode surface tokens, light mode surface tokens, border tokens).

**Blocker status:** active — Figma seat/capacity blocker prevents MCP execution (`View` + tool-call limit).

---

## Open decisions / blockers

- Figma permission/capacity blocker:
  - file access must be upgraded to `Editor`
  - MCP plan/call allowance must be sufficient for style update + validation pass
- CI follow-up: if `visual_parity` fails on GitHub, calibrate only failing snapshots using measured CI diff evidence and sync exception docs in same cycle.
- S-07/S-08 remain code-precompleted; design work stays pending until Figma unblock is resolved.
